README: MapChat

I spent about five hours on this assignment.
I recieved assistance from a few TAs and used modified stackoverflow code 
(as given in the spec) to define my Haversine Formula function. 

I modified Ming's example code for the geolocation object and used his
CSS file for rendering the map. 

I discussed the assignment with Rachael Robinson, Bruno Olmedo, 
and Daniel Baigel. 

To the best of my knowledge, everything is implemented correctly.
