# Finalizing my learning portfolio

(1) The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my work over the duration of this course! Yay open source!

(2) After some thinking, I've decided that my favorite assignment was actually assignment 3. I think that the reason that I feel this way is because of my situation with my computer. I did the assignment entirely at home and with almost no assistance from TAs or anyone (although I did at one point text messsage Yotam Bentov). While it was definitely frustrating to feel like my only resource was myself and the internet, I think that I learned so much more than I would have otherwise. It was an awesome feeling. Additionally, adding the server-side piece of the puzzle made me feel as if I had a more full understanding of web dev! 

(3) I think that I've learned to be much more rational and persistent in my problem-solving skills. Despite having to be pretty self-reliant in COMP 40, I still think that this class was a much more self-dependent course. That was really scary to me at first and I am learning more and more every day that I can figure out the answers to my questions. I have that ability and that's amazing. 

(4) This is going to sound really trivial but the most important thing I learned in this class was how HTTP works. I feel like I actually understand the internet when I use it and even though I guess it didn't matter that I didn't understand it before I feel a lot more wise now. 
 
(5) I would honestly really like to learn a lot more about design. It's cool that there are frameworks like bootstrap to help you make your applications look good, but I want to be a real creator! Additionally, I am really interested in learning about developing applications with secure user authentication.
